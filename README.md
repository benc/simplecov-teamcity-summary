# SimpleCov::TeamcitySummary

[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/simplecov-teamcity-summary.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/rb/simplecov-teamcity-summary)

By default, Teamcity [does not pick up coverage information for SimpleCov reports](https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/TCD9/Code+Coverage). This gem provides you with a quick and easy way to add these statistics to your Teamcity instance.

Per build:

Overall coverage statistics:

With these statistics, you can trigger a build fail if coverage drops below a certain value:
